# MediaCrush-cli

Uploads files to MediaCrush from your favorite shell.

## Installation

Simply copy the files where you'd like, `mediacrush` goes in `/usr/bin/`. Compile the manpage
with `a2x --doctype manpage --format manpage mediacrush.1.txt` and put the manpage in
`/usr/share/man/man1/mediacrush.1` (gzipped). If you want to use a different prefix, you know
what do to.
